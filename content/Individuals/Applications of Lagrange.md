 > Suppose that $G$ is a group with $\lvert G \rvert=p$, where $p$ is prime. Then $G$ is a [cyclic group](Cyclic%20Subgroups.md)

###### Proof

Choose $g\in G$ with $g\ne e$. Then $H:=\langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$ with at least two elements ($e$ and $g$). But by [Lagrange's Theorem](..\Mathematics\Lagrange's%20Theorem.md), $\lvert H \rvert$ must divide $\lvert G \rvert = p$. $\lvert H \rvert \geq 2$, Hence $\lvert H \rvert=p$ and so $H = G$

###### Proof

* If $\lvert G \rvert = 1$, then $G$ is abelian
* If $\lvert G \rvert =$ $2$, $3$, or $5$, then $G$ is cyclic by the [Prime size group theorem](Prime%20size%20group%20theorem.md)
* The only other case is $\lvert G \rvert = 4$.
