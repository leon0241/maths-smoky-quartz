 > 1. The set $A$ is *bounded above* if there exists some $b\in S$ such that $x\le b$ for all $x\in A$; in this case, $b$ is called an *upper bound* of $A$.
 > 1. The *least upper bound* of A - if it exists - is some $b\_{0}\in S$ such that (1) $b\_{0}$ is an upper bound of $A$, and (2) if $b$ is any other upper bound of $A$, then $b\_{0}\le b$. Such a $b\_{0}$ is also called the *supremum* of $A$ and is denoted by $sup(A)$.
 > 1. The set $A$ is *bounded below* if there exists some $b\in S$ such that $x\ge b$ for all $x\in A$; in this case, $b$ is called an *lower bound* of $A$.
 > 1. The greatest lower bound\* of A - if it exists - is some $b\_{0}\in S$ such that (1) $b\_{0}$ is an lower bound of $A$, and (2) if $b$ is any other lower bound of $A$, then $b\_{0}\ge b$. Such a $b\_{0}$ is also called the *inimum* of $A$ and is denoted by $inf(A)$.
 > 1. If a set is both bounded above and bounded below, then it is simply called *bounded*.
