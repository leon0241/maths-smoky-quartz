###### Proof

We prove the first part (the second part is the contrapositive of the first part).
Since $a_n\leq b_n$ for all $n$, it follows that 
$$0\leq a_1 + a_2 + \cdots+a_n \le b_1 + b_2 + \cdots + b_n$$
If $\sum_n b_n$ converges, then $b_1 + b_2 + \cdots + b_n$ is bounded, therefore $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$ is bounded as well, therefore $\sum_n a_n$ converges
