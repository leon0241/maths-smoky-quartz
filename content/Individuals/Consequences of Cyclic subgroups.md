 > If $g\in G$, then $o(g)=/lvert /langle g /rangle /rvert$, i.e. the [order of an element](Order%20of%20a%20Group.md#order-of-a-group-order-of-an-element) equals the order of the subgroup that it generates

 > \[!Remark\]+
 > If $G$ is cyclic, then necessarily $G$ is abelian. In particular, $D\_{3}$ is not cyclic, since $gh\ne hg$

 > \[!Theorem\]+
 > Let $G$ be a [cyclic group](Cyclic%20Subgroups.md#cyclic-subgroups), and let $H$ be a [subgroup](Cyclic%20Subgroups.md#subgroups) of $G$. Then $H$ is cyclic.

 > Let $m,n\in \N$, let $G=\langle g \rangle$ be a [cyclic group](Cyclic%20Subgroups.md) of [order](Cyclic%20Subgroups.md#order-of-a-group) $m$ and $H=\langle h \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$. Then
