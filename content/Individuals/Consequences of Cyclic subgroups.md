> If $g\in G$, then $o(g)=\lvert \langle g \rangle \rvert$, i.e. the [[Order of a Group#Order of a Group Order of an element|order of an element]] equals the order of the subgroup that it generates

> [!Remark]+
> If $G$ is cyclic, then necessarily $G$ is abelian. In particular, $D_{3}$ is not cyclic, since $gh\ne hg$

> [!Lemma]+
> Let $G$ be a finite group. Then
> $$G \text{ is cyclic} \iff G \text{ contains an element of order } \lvert G \rvert $$

> [!Theorem]+
> Let $G$ be a [[Cyclic Subgroups#Cyclic Subgroups|cyclic group]], and let $H$ be a [[Subgroups#Subgroups|subgroup]] of $G$. Then $H$ is cyclic.

> [!Theorem]+
> Let $m,n\in \N$, let $G=\langle g \rangle$ be a [[Cyclic Subgroups|cyclic group]] of [[Order of a Group#Order of a Group|order]] $m$ and $H=\langle h \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$. Then
> $$G \times H \text{ is cyclic} \iff m \text{ and } n \text{ are coprime (i.e. gcd(m,n) = 1)}$$
