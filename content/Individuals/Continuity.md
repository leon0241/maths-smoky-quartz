 > Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of $\R$. The function $f$ is *continuous* at $x\_{0}$ in $\dom{(f)}$ if, for every sequence $(x\_{n})$ in $\dom{(f)}$ converging to $x\_{0}$, we have 
 > $$\displaystyle\lim\_{ n \to \infty }f(x\_{n})=f(a)$$
 > If $f$ is continuous at each $a\in S \subseteq \dom{(f)}$ and then we say that $f$ is continuous on $S$. If $f$ is continuous on $\dom{(f)}$ then we say that $f$ is continuous
