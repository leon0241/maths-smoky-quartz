 > Suppose for each $n\in\N_0$ that $P(n)$ is a proposition (a verbal statement or a formula) that satisfies the following two properties: 
 > 
 > 1. $P(0)$ is true
 > 1. For every $k\in\N_0$ for which $P(k)$ is true, $P(k+1)$ is also true.
 > 
 > Then for every integer $n\in\N_0$ the proposition $P(n)$ is true.
