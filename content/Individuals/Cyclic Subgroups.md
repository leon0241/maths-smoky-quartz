 > A subgroup $H\le G$ is *cyclic* if $H = \langle h \rangle$ for some $h\in H$. In this case, we say that $H$ is the *cyclic subgroup generated by h*. If $G=\langle g \rangle$ for some $g\in G$, then we say that the group $G$ is *cyclic*, and that $g$ is a *generator*.

 > * $\Z\_{n}$ under addition is cyclic, since $\langle 1 \rangle = \Z\_{n}$
 >   From [power subset](Definition%20of%20the%20power%20subset.md), the group $\langle 1 \rangle$ is defined as
 >   $$\begin{align}
 >   \\langle 1 \rangle &= {1,,1^{2},,1^3,,\dots ,,1^n} \\
 >   &= {1,,1+1, , 1+1+1,, \dots,, \underbrace{1+\dots+1}*{n}} \\
 >   &= {1,,2,,3,,\dots,,n} \\
 >   &= \mathbb{Z}*{n}
 >   \\end{align}$$
 > * In $\Z\_{8}$ the cyclic subgroup generated by $2$ is $\langle 2 \rangle = {0,2,4,6}$. This is strictly contained in $\Z\_{8}$ therefore it is a cyclic subgroup
 > * In $D\_{n}$, the subgroup $H$ consisting of the identity and all the rotations, i.e.
 > * $$H = {e,,g,,g^2,,\dots,,g^{n-1}}$$
 >   is a cyclic subgroup since $H = \langle g \rangle$. Note also that $H=\langle g^{-1} \rangle$
