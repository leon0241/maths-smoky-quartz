> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Cyclic Subgroups]]
> A subgroup $H\le G$ is *cyclic* if $H = \langle h \rangle$ for some $h\in H$. In this case, we say that $H$ is the *cyclic subgroup generated by h*. If $G=\langle g \rangle$ for some $g\in G$, then we say that the group $G$ is *cyclic*, and that $g$ is a *generator*.
