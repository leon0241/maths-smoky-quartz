 > A subgroup $H\le G$ is *cyclic* if $H = \langle h \rangle$ for some $h\in H$. In this case, we say that $H$ is the *cyclic subgroup generated by h*. If $G=\langle g \rangle$ for some $g\in G$, then we say that the group $G$ is *cyclic*, and that $g$ is a *generator*.

 > * $$H = {e,,g,,g^2,,\dots,,g^{n-1}}$$
 >   is a cyclic subgroup since $H = \langle g \rangle$. Note also that $H=\langle g^{-1} \rangle$
