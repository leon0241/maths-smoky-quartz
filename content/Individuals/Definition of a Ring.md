 > A ring is an algebraic structure that generalises [fields](Field%20Axioms%20of%20R.md). Multiplication doesn't have to be commutative, and multiplicative inverses don't need to exist. Rings can numbers such as [integers](Defining%20Subsets%20of%20R%20%28N,Z,Q%29.md) or complex numbers, but they may also be non-numerical objects such as polynomials, square matrices, functions, and power series.
