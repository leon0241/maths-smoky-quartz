 > The dihedral group $D\_{n}$ is the group of the symmetries of a n-gon. 
 > e.g. $D\_{3}$ is the symmetries of a triangle, so it consists of $$D\_{3} = {e,,g,,g^{2},,h,,hg,,hg^{2}}$$
 > where $e$ is the identity, $g$ represents a rotation of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, and $h$ is a reflection
 > There are exactly $2n$ elements in the group $D\_{n}$, namely
 > 
 > * $e$, the identity
 > * ${g,g^2,\dots,g^{n-1}}$, the set of $2\pi/n$ rotations
 > * $h$, a horizontal reflection
 > * ${hg,hg^{2},\dots hg^{n-1}}$, the set of reflected rotations
