> - $G$ is a subgroup of itself. Also, $\{e\}$ is a subgroup of $G$, called the *trivial subgroup*
> - $\Z<\Q<\R<\C$ under addition
> - Consider $G=S_{3}$. Let $H$ denote all the premutations that send $1$ to itself. The two permutations are the identity, and the one that swaps $2$ and $3$ (Reflection). Then $H<G$
> - Let $G=\Z_{8}$ under addition, and let $H=\{0,2,4,6\}$. Then $H<G$
> - More generally let $G=\Z_{n}$ where $n=kl$ with $k,l>1$. Then $H<G$ where
> $$H=\{0,k,2,\dots,(l-1)k\}$$
