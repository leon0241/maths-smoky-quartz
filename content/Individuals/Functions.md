 > \[!Definition\] Def: [Injective Function](Functions.md)
 > A function $f: X\to Y$ is called *injective* if:
 > 
 > * The function is one to one, in other words one element of $X$ maps to one element of $Y$
 > * $f(x\_{1}) = f(x\_{2})$ implies that $x\_{1}=x\_{2}$, or if $x\_{1}\ne x\_{2}$ then $f(x\_{1}) \ne f(x\_{2})$

 > 
 > \[!Definition\] Def: [Surjective Function](Functions.md)
 > A function $f: X\to Y$ is called *surjective* if:
 > 
 > * Every element of $Y$ has a mapping from at least one element of $X$
 > * For every $y\in Y$, there exists an $x\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$
 > * $\forall y\in Y, \enspace \exists x\in X,\enspace f(x) = y$

 > 
 > \[!Definition\] Def: [Bijective Function](Functions.md)
 > A function $f: X\to Y$ is called *bijective* if it is both [injective](Functions.md#functions-injective-function) and [surjective](Functions.md#functions-surjective-function)
