 > Suppose that $G$ is a group with $\lvert G \rvert \< 6$. Then $G$ is [abelian](Abelian%20Group.md)

###### Proof

* If $\lvert G \rvert = 1$, then $G$ is abelian
* If $\lvert G \rvert =$ $2$, $3$, or $5$, then $G$ is cyclic by the [Prime size group theorem](Prime%20size%20group%20theorem.md)
* The only other case is $\lvert G \rvert = 4$.
