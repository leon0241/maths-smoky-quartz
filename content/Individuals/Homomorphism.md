 > A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type. A homomorphism may also be an [Isomorphism](Isomorphism.md), Endomorphiam, Automorphism, etc.
 > Homomorphisms also preseve operations of structures. This means that a map $f:A\to B$ between two sets $A,B$ equipped with the same structure s.t. if $\cdot$ is an operation then $f(x\cdot y)=f(x)\cdot f(y)$
