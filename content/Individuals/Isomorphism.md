 > An *isomorphism* between two graphs is a [bijection](Functions.md#functions-bijective-function) between them that preserves all edges. More precisely, if $\Gamma\_{1}$ and $\Gamma\_{2}$ are graphs, with sets of vertices $V\_{1}$ and $V\_{2}$ respectively, then an *isomorphism* from $\Gamma\_{1}$ and $\Gamma\_{2}$ is a bijection
 > $$f : V\_{1}\to V\_{2}$$
 > such that $f(v\_{1})$ and $f(v\_{2})$ are joined by an edge if and only if $v\_{1}$ and $v\_{2}$ are also joined by an edge.
 > We say that $\Gamma\_{1}$ and $\Gamma\_{2}$ are *isomorphic* if there exists an isomorphism $f:\Gamma\_{1}\to\Gamma\_{2}$

 > A map $f:A\to B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an *isomorphism* if there exists a map $g:B\to A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $gf=1\_{A}$ and $fg=1\_{B}$.
 > In this situation, we call $g$ the \*inverse of $f$ and write $g=f^{-1}$. If there exists an isomorphism from $A$ to $B$, we say that $A$ and $B$ are *isomorphic* and write $A\iso B$.
