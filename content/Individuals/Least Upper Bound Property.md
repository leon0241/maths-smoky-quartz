> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Least Upper Bound Property]]
> Let $S$ be an ordered field (like $\R$). Then $S$ has the *least upper bound property* if given any nonempty $A\subseteq S$ where $A$ is bounded above, $A$ has a least upper bound in $S$. In other words, $sup(A)\in S$ for every such $A$.
> Such a set is called *complete*
