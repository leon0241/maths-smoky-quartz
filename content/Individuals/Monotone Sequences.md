 > Let $(s\_{n})$ be a sequence of real numbers.
 > 
 > * $(s\_{n})$ is said to be increasing if $s\_{1}\le s\_{2}\le s\_{3}\le\cdots$, and strictly increasing if $s\_{1}\<s\_{2}\<s\_{3}\<\\cdots$
 > * $(s\_{n})$ is said to be decreasing if $s\_{1}\ge s\_{2}\ge s\_{3}\ge\cdots$, and strictly decreasing if $s\_{1}>s\_{2}>s\_{3}>\cdots$
 > * $(s\_{n})$ is said to be monotone if it is either increasing or decreasing
