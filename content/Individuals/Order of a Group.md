 > A *finite group* $G$ is one with only a finite number of elements. The *order* of a finite group, written $\lvert G \rvert$, is the number of elements in $G$. (Note that if $X$ is a set, we also often write $\lvert X \rvert$ to be the number of elements in $X$.)

 > Let $G$ be a group and $g\in G$. Then the *order* $o(g)$ of $g$ is the *least* natural number $n$ such that
 > $$g^n = e$$
 > If no such $n$ exists, we say that $g$ has infinite order

 > Consider $1\in\Z$ under addition. Then $1*1=1+1=2,,1*1*1=3,\dots$
 > $$\underbrace{1*\\dots\*1}\_{n} = n \ne 0 =e$$
 > for any $n>0$. Hence, $1\in\Z$ has infinite order.
