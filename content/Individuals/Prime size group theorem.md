 > Suppose that $G$ is a group with $\lvert G \rvert=p$, where $p$ is prime. Then $G$ is a [cyclic group](Cyclic%20Subgroups.md)

###### Proof

Choose $g\in G$ with $g\ne e$. Then $H:=\langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$ with at least two elements ($e$ and $g$). But by [Lagrange's Theorem](..\Mathematics\Lagrange's%20Theorem.md), $\lvert H \rvert$ must divide $\lvert G \rvert = p$. $\lvert H \rvert \geq 2$, Hence $\lvert H \rvert=p$ and so $H = G$
