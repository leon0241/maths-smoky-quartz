> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Ring Axioms]]
> A ring is a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ satisfying the following sets of axioms:
> 1. $R$ is an [[Abelian Group|abelian group]] under addition, meaning that [[Field Axioms of R]] F1-F4 hold.
>2. $R$ is a [[Moniod|moniod]] under multiplication, meaning that
>	- $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a\cdot(b\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c\in R$
>	- There is an element $1$ in $R$ such that $a\cdot 1=1\cdot a=1$ for all $a\in R$
>3. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, meaning that [[Field Axioms of R]] F8 holds.
