 > A ring is a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ satisfying the following sets of axioms:
 > 
 > 1. $R$ is an [abelian group](Abelian%20Group.md) under addition, meaning that [Field Axioms of R](Field%20Axioms%20of%20R.md) F1-F4 hold.
 > 1. $R$ is a [moniod](Moniod.md) under multiplication, meaning that
 > 
 > * $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a\cdot(b\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c\in R$
 > * There is an element $1$ in $R$ such that $a\cdot 1=1\cdot a=1$ for all $a\in R$
 > 
 > 3. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, meaning that [Field Axioms of R](Field%20Axioms%20of%20R.md) F8 holds.
