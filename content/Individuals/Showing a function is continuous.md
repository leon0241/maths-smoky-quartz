 > A function $f$ is continuous is for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that for all $x \in A$ for which $0\<\\lvert x-c \rvert \<\\delta$, we have $\lvert f(x)-L \rvert \< \epsilon$.

 > To show a function isn't continuous, negate the above statement to get:
 > There exists $\epsilon>0$ such that for all $\delta>0$ there exists some $x \in A$ satisfying $0\<\\lvert x-c \rvert\<\\delta$ for which $\lvert  f(x)-L \rvert\ge \epsilon$
