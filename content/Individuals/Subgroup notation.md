###### Reasoning

Just to make life easier, but when dealing with groups under addition it may be confusing as we are used to $\*$ for multiplication.

 > It is useful to have a shorthand for expression such as $g\*\\dots*g$. If $G$ is a group, $g\in G$ and $k\in\Z$, we define the power $g^k$ by

 > \\hspace{12pt}\overbrace{g*\\dots*g}^{k} &\text{if } k>0 \\
 > \\hspace{30pt} e &\text{if } k = 0 \\
 > \\underbrace{ g^{-1}*\\dots\*g^{-1} }\_{ -k } &\text{if } k \< 0
 > \\end{cases}
