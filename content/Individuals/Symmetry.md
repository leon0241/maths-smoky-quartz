 > \[!Definition\]+ Def: [Symmetry](Symmetry.md)
 > A *symmetry* of a graph is an [isomorphism](Isomorphism.md#isomorphism) from the graph to itself, i.e. if the set of vertices is V, then the symmetry is a bijection $f:V\to V$ that preserves edges. That is, a symmetry is a bijection $f:V\to V$ such that $f(v\_{1})$ and $f(v\_{2})$ are joined by an edge if and only if $v\_{1}$ and $v\_{2}$ are joined by an edge.

 > 
 > \[!Remark\] Rem: [Valency Preservation of symmetries](Symmetry.md)
 > A symmetry $f:V\to V$ must preserve the valency of a vertex. For example, if $v\_{1}$ has valency three, then $f(v\_{1})$ must also have valency three.
