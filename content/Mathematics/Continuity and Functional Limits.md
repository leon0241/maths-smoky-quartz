 > Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of $\R$. The function $f$ is *continuous* at $x\_{0}$ in $\dom{(f)}$ if, for every sequence $(x\_{n})$ in $\dom{(f)}$ converging to $x\_{0}$, we have 
 > $$\displaystyle\lim\_{ n \to \infty }f(x\_{n})=f(a)$$
 > If $f$ is continuous at each $a\in S \subseteq \dom{(f)}$ and then we say that $f$ is continuous on $S$. If $f$ is continuous on $\dom{(f)}$ then we say that $f$ is continuous

 > A function $f$ is continuous is for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that for all $x \in A$ for which $0\<\\lvert x-c \rvert \<\\delta$, we have $\lvert f(x)-L \rvert \< \epsilon$.

 > We also say $\displaystyle\lim\_{x \to c}f(x)$ *converges* to L in such a situation
