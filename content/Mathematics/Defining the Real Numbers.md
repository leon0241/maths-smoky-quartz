> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Defining the Real Numbers|Definition of the Reals]]
> The definition of the Real numbers, denoted by $\R$ is built from 3 parts and defined by Axioms (rules that we take as a given and don't need to prove)
> 1. Field which is an algebraic object
> 2. Ordering which is compatible with the field
> 3. Completeness which ensures there is no "gaps" in the field
