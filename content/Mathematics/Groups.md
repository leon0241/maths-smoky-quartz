 > \[!Theorem\]+ Thm: [Defining a Group](../Individuals/Defining%20a%20Group.md)
 > 
 > For any operation $\ast$, We say a non-empty set G is a *group* under $\ast$, or more formally that (G, $\ast$) is a group, if the following four axioms hold:
 > 
 > * **G1 - Closure:** $\ast$ is a binary operation on G, that is $a\ast b \in G$ for all $a,b\in G$.
 > * **G2 - Associativity:** $(a\ast b) \ast c =a\ast(b\ast c)$ for all $a,b,c\in G$
 > * **G3 - Existence of identity:** There exists an *identity element* or *neutral element* of $G$ such that $e\ast g = g\ast e = e$ for all $g\in G$. 
 > * **G4 - Existence of inverses:** Every element $g\in G$ has an *inverse* $g^{-1}$ such that $g\ast g^{-1}=g^{-1}\ast g = e$

 > \[!Definition\]+ Def: [Abelian Group](../Individuals/Abelian%20Group.md)
 > 
 > The definition of a group doesn't require that $a\ast b = b\ast a$.
 > We say that a group is *abelian* or *commutative* if $a\ast b = b\ast a$ for every $a,b\in G$. If $a,b\in G$ are sucsh that $a\ast b = b\ast a$ we say that $a$ *commutes* with $b$ or that $a$ and $b$ *commute*

 > 
 > If $G$ is a finite group, the number of elements in $G$ is written $\lvert G \rvert$ and is called the *order* of $G$. If $G$ is infinite we say that $\lvert G \rvert = \infty$, or the order of $G$ is infinite.
