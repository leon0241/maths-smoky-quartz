>[!Definition]+ Def: [[Infinite Series|Partial Sums of an Infinite Series]]
>Let $S = \dsumoinf a_k$ be an infinite series with terms $a_k$. For each $n$ the partial sum of S of order n is defined by
>$$s_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n a_k$$

> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Infinite Series|Convergence of an Infinite Series]]
> A series S is said to converge iff its sequence of partial sums $(s_n)$ converges to some $s\in\R$ as $n\to\infty$. That is for any $\epsilon>0$ there exists an $N\in\N$ such that if $n\ge\N$ we have
> $$|s_n-s| = \Bigg|\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n a_k-s\Bigg| < \epsilon$$
> In this case, we write
> $$\dsumoinf a_k = s$$
> and call the number $s$ the sum or value of the series $\dsumoinf a_k$.
> The series S is said to diverge if its sequence of partial sums $(s_n)$ diverges as $n\to\infty$. This can mean $s_n\to\pm\infty$ or that the limit is not defined (in either case the limit is not a real number). When $(s_n)$ diverges to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ we write
> $$\dsumoinf a_k = \infty \text{ } $$
