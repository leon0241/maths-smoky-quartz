> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Subgroups|Subgroup]]
> Let $G$ be a [[Groups|group]]. We say that a non-empty subset $H$ of $G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ itself is a group (under the operation from $G$). We write $H\le G$ if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. If also $H\ne G$, we write $H<G$ and say that $H$ is a proper subgroup

> [!Lemma] Lem: [[Subgroups|Inherited elements of subgroups]]
> Suppose that $H\le G$. Then,
> 1. $e_{H} = e_{G}$
> 2. if $h\in H$, the inverse of $h$ in $H$ equals the inverse of $h$ in $G$
