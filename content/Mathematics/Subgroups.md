 > \[!Definition\]+ Def: [Subgroup](Subgroups.md)
 > Let $G$ be a [group](Groups.md). We say that a non-empty subset $H$ of $G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ itself is a group (under the operation from $G$). We write $H\le G$ if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. If also $H\ne G$, we write $H\<G$ and say that $H$ is a proper subgroup

 > 
 > \[!Lemma\] Lem: [Inherited elements of subgroups](Subgroups.md)
 > Suppose that $H\le G$. Then,
 > 
 > 1. $e\_{H} = e\_{G}$
 > 1. if $h\in H$, the inverse of $h$ in $H$ equals the inverse of $h$ in $G$


 > 
 > \[!Theorem\]+ Thm: [Test for a subgroup](../Individuals/Test%20for%20a%20subgroup.md)
 > $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if:
 > 
 > * **S1:** $H$ is not empty
 > * **S2:** If $h,k\in H$ then $h\ast k\in H$
 > * **S3:** If $h\in H$ then $h^{-1}\in H$
 > 
 > Alternative test for subgroups:
 > 
 > * $\widetilde{S1}$: $H$ is not empty.
 > * $\widetilde{S2}$: If $h,k\in H$ then $h\*k^{-1}\in H$

 > \[!Definition\]+ Def: [Order of a Group](../Individuals/Order%20of%20a%20Group.md)
 > A *finite group* $G$ is one with only a finite number of elements. The *order* of a finite group, written $\lvert G \rvert$, is the number of elements in $G$. (Note that if $X$ is a set, we also often write $\lvert X \rvert$ to be the number of elements in $X$.)

 > \[!Definition\]+ Def: [Cyclic Subgroups](../Individuals/Cyclic%20Subgroups.md)
 > A subgroup $H\le G$ is *cyclic* if $H = \langle h \rangle$ for some $h\in H$. In this case, we say that $H$ is the *cyclic subgroup generated by h*. If $G=\langle g \rangle$ for some $g\in G$, then we say that the group $G$ is *cyclic*, and that $g$ is a *generator*.

 > 
 > * $\Z\_{n}$ under addition is cyclic, since $\langle 1 \rangle = \Z\_{n}$
 >   From [power subset](../Individuals/Definition%20of%20the%20power%20subset.md), the group $\langle 1 \rangle$ is defined as
 >   $$\begin{align}
 >   \\langle 1 \rangle &= {1,,1^{2},,1^3,,\dots ,,1^n} \\
 >   &= {1,,1+1, , 1+1+1,, \dots,, \underbrace{1+\dots+1}*{n}} \\
 >   &= {1,,2,,3,,\dots,,n} \\
 >   &= \mathbb{Z}*{n}
 >   \\end{align}$$
 > * In $\Z\_{8}$ the cyclic subgroup generated by $2$ is $\langle 2 \rangle = {0,2,4,6}$. This is strictly contained in $\Z\_{8}$ therefore it is a cyclic subgroup
 > * In $D\_{n}$, the subgroup $H$ consisting of the identity and all the rotations, i.e.
 > * $$H = {e,,g,,g^2,,\dots,,g^{n-1}}$$
 >   is a cyclic subgroup since $H = \langle g \rangle$. Note also that $H=\langle g^{-1} \rangle$
