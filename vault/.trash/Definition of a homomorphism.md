> Let $G,H$ be groups. A map $\phi:G\to H$ is called a *group homomorphism* if
> $$\phi(xy)=\phi(x)\phi(y)\quad \text{for all } x,y\in G$$
> Note that the product $xy$ on the left is formed using the group operation in $G$, while the prodct $\phi(x)\phi(y)$ is formed using the group operation in $H$
