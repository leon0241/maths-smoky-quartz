> - Let $G$ and $H$ be two isomorphic finite groups and let $k$ be a postive integer. Prove that $G$ and $H$ have the same number of elements of order $k$
> - using part (a) or otherwise, prove that the groups $S_{4}$ and $D_{12}$ are not isomorphic

The *kernel* of $\phi$ is 
$$\ker{\phi} := \{g\in G|\phi(g)=e_{H}\}$$
show that the kernel of $G$ is the same as the kernel of $H$.
(for elements $g^k$)
