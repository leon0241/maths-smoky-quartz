> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Category of Logic]]
> Given a deductive system of logic, there is an associated *category of proofs*, where the objects are formulas:
> $$\phi,\psi, \dots$$
> An arrow from $\phi$ to $\psi$ is a deduction of $\psi$ from the (uncanceled) assumption $\phi$.
> $$\phi \,|\,\dots\,|\,\psi$$
> Composition of arrows is given by putting such deductions in the obvious way, which is clearly associative i.e. syllogisms. Observe that there can be many different arrows
> $$p:\phi\to\psi$$
> since there may be many different such proofs.
