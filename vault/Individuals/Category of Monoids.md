> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Category of Monoids]]
> There is a [[Definition of a Category#^824748|category]] $\text{Mon}$ whose objects are [[Definition of a Monoid#^57cfb9|monoids]] and whose arrows are functions that preserve the monoid structure. In detail, a [[Homomorphism#^1f6dd3|homomorphism]] from a monoid $M$ to a monoid $N$ is a function $h:M\to N$ such that for all $m,n\in M$,
> $$h(m\cdot_{M}n)=h(m)\cdot_{N}h(n)$$
