> [!Theorem]+ Thm: [[Commutative Subgroup Theorem]]
> Let $(G,*)$ be a group and $H,K$ be a subgroups of $G$. If every element of $H$ commutes with every element of $K$, then the subset $HK$ of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$

#### Proof
Use the subgroup test

> [!Remark]+
> Let $(G,*)$ be an abelian group, and $H,K$ be subgroups of $G$. Then the subset $HK$ of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.
