> [!Remark]+ Rem: [[Consequences of Cyclic groups|Subgroup order]]
> If $g\in G$, then $o(g)=\lvert \langle g \rangle \rvert$, i.e. the [[Order of a Group#Order of a Group Order of an element|order of an element]] equals the order of the subgroup that it generates

> [!Remark]+ Rem: [[Consequences of Cyclic groups|Cyclic Abelian]]
> If $G$ is cyclic, then necessarily $G$ is abelian. In particular, $D_{3}$ is not cyclic, since $gh\ne hg$

> [!Remark]+ Lem: [[Consequences of Cyclic groups|Cyclic elements of same order]]
> Let $G$ be a finite group. Then
> $$G \text{ is cyclic} \iff G \text{ contains an element of order } \lvert G \rvert $$

> [!Theorem]+ Thm: [[Consequences of Cyclic groups|Cyclic subgroup Theorem]]
> Let $G$ be a [[Cyclic Subgroups#Cyclic Subgroups|cyclic group]], and let $H$ be a [[Subgroups#Subgroups|subgroup]] of $G$. Then $H$ is cyclic.
