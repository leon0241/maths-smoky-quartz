> - For $m\in \Z, g^m=g^r$ where $r$ is the remainder on division of $m$ by $n$.
> - The order of the cyclic subgroup $\langle g \rangle$ generated by $g$ is $n$
> - For $m\in \Z, g^m=e$ if and only if $m$ is a multiple of $n$

#### Proof
- Divide $m$ by $n$ and let $r$ be the remainder. Thus, $0\le r < n$ and $n=nq+r$ for some integer $q$. Therefore:
$$g^m=g^{nq+r}=g^{nq}g^r=(g^n)^qg^r=e^qg^r=g^r$$
