> Let $f$ be a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of $\R$. The function $f$ is *continuous* at $x_{0}$ in $\dom{(f)}$ if, for every sequence $(x_{n})$ in $\dom{(f)}$ converging to $x_{0}$, we have 
> $$\displaystyle\lim_{ n \to \infty }f(x_{n})=f(a)$$
> If $f$ is continuous at each $a\in S \subseteq \dom{(f)}$ and then we say that $f$ is continuous on $S$. If $f$ is continuous on $\dom{(f)}$ then we say that $f$ is continuous
