> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Definition of a Monoid]]
> A *monoid* (sometimes called a *semigroup with unit*) is a set $M$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot: M\times M\to M$ and an identity element $u\in M$ such that for all $x,y,z\in M$,
> $$x\cdot(y\cdot z) =(x\cdot y) \cdot z$$
> and
> $$u\cdot x = x = x \cdot u$$
> A monoid can be thought of as a category of one object. The arrows of the category are the elements of the monoid, and the identity arrow is the unit element u. Composition of arrows is the binary operation $m\cdot n$ of the monoid.
