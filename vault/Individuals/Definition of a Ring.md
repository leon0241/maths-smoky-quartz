> [!Definition]+  Def: [[Definition of a Ring]]
> A ring is an algebraic structure that generalises [[Field Axioms of R|fields]]. Multiplication doesn't have to be commutative, and multiplicative inverses don't need to exist. Rings can numbers such as [[Defining Subsets of R - N,Z,Q|integers]] or complex numbers, but they may also be non-numerical objects such as polynomials, square matrices, functions, and power series.
