> A *symmetry* of a graph is an [[Isomorphism#Isomorphism|isomorphism]] from the graph to itself, i.e. if the set of vertices is V, then the symmetry is a bijection $f:V\to V$ that preserves edges. That is, a symmetry is a bijection $f:V\to V$ such that $f(v_{1})$ and $f(v_{2})$ are joined by an edge if and only if $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are joined by an edge.

> [!Remark] Rem: [[Definition of a Symmetry|Valency Preservation of symmetries]]
> A symmetry $f:V\to V$ must preserve the valency of a vertex. For example, if $v_{1}$ has valency three, then $f(v_{1})$ must also have valency three.

> [!Remark]+ Rem: [[Definition of a Symmetry|Shape freedom of symmetries]]
> As symmetries just need to be an isomorphism to work, the shape of two graphs does not need to be the same for a symmetry to hold. These two shapes in the sense of a graph are identical
