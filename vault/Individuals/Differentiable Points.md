> A function $f:I\to \R$, where $I$ is an open interval, is said to be *differentiable* at a point $x_{0}$ in $I$, if and only if the difference quotient
> $$Q(x)=\frac{f(x)-f(x_{0})}{x-x_{0}},\qquad (x\ne x_{0})$$
> has a real limit as $x\to x_{0}$. If that is the csae, we define the derivative of $f$ at $x_{0}$ by
> $$f'(x_{0})=\lim_{x \to x_{0}} Q(x)=\lim_{x \to x_{0}} \frac{f(x)-f(x0)}{x-x_{0}}$$
