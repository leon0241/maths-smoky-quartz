> [!Theorem]+ Thm: [[Differentiation and Continuity]]
> Let $I$ be an open interval, $x_{0}\in I$ and $f:I\to \R$ be differentiable at $x_{0}$. Then $f$ is continuous at $x_{0}$

> The converse of this statement isn't true. a counterexample is the function $f:\R\to\R,\,f(x)=\lvert x \rvert$. It is continuous everywhere but not differentiable at $0$
