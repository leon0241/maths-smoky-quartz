> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Discrete Category]]
> Let $X$ be a set. We can regard $X$ as a category $\text{Dis}(x)$ by taking the objects to be the elements of $X$ and taking the arrows to only be the identity arrows, one for each $x\in X$ Such categories where the only arrows are identities are called *discrete*. Note that disicrete categories are just special posets.
