> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Dual Category]]
> The *opposite* or *dual* category $C^{\text{op}}$ of a category $C$ has the same objects as $C$, but arrows $f:c\to d$ in $C$ are arrows $f:d\to c$ in $C^{\text{op}}$. That is, $C^{\text{op}}$ is just $C$ with all the arrows turned around.

> [!Notation]+ Ntn: [[Dual Category|Dual Category notation]]
> It is convenient to have a notation to distinguish an object or arrow in $C$ from the same one in $C^{\text{op}}$. Thus let us write
> $$f^*:d^*\to c^*$$
> in $C^{\text{op}}$ for $f:c\to d$ in $C$. We can then define composition and units in $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}$ in terms of the operations in $C$, namely,
> $$1_{c^*}= (1_{c})^*$$
> $$f^*\circ g^*=(g\circ f)^*$$
