> - $\Z_{n}$ under addition is cyclic, since $\langle 1 \rangle = \Z_{n}$
> From [[Definition of the power subset|power subset]], the group $\langle 1 \rangle$ is defined as
> $$\begin{align}
\langle 1 \rangle &= \{1,\,1^{2},\,1^3,\,\dots ,\,1^n\} \\
&= \{1,\,1+1, \, 1+1+1,\, \dots,\, \underbrace{1+\dots+1}_{n}\} \\
&= \{1,\,2,\,3,\,\dots,\,n\} \\
&= \mathbb{Z}_{n}
\end{align}$$
> - In $\Z_{8}$ the cyclic subgroup generated by $2$ is $\langle 2 \rangle = \{0,2,4,6\}$. This is strictly contained in $\Z_{8}$ therefore it is a cyclic subgroup
> - In $D_{n}$, the subgroup $H$ consisting of the identity and all the rotations, i.e.
> - $$H = \{e,\,g,\,g^2,\,\dots,\,g^{n-1}\}$$
> is a cyclic subgroup since $H = \langle g \rangle$. Note also that $H=\langle g^{-1} \rangle$
