> The [[Definition of a Group Action#^f76637|action]] of a [[Definition of a Group#^7b096a|group]] $G$ on a set $X$ is said to be *faithful* if and only if the only element of $x$ of $G$ that has the property
> $$\forall x \in X,\,\quad g\cdot x=x$$
> is $g=e$. The set of all $g\in G$ with this property is called the *kernel* of the action.
