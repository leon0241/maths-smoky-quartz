> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Field Axioms of R]]
> The set $\R$ is equipped with the algebraic operations $+$ and $\cdot$ (Domain $\R\times\R$, and range $\R$). We assume that the triple ($\R,+,\cdot$) is a field which means it satisfies the following for every $a, b,c\in\R$
> - **F1 - Closure:** $a + b$ and $a \cdot b$ belong to $\R$
> - **F2 - Associativity:** $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a \cdot(b\cdot c)$.
> - **F3 - Commutativity:** $a+b = b+a$ and $a\cdot b = b\cdot a$
> - **F4 - Existence of the Additive Identity:** There is a unique element $0\in\R$ such that $0 + a = a$ for all $a\in\R$
> - **F5 - Existence of the Multiplicative Identity:** There is a unique element $1\in\R$ such that $1\ne0$ and $1\cdot a = a$ for all $a\in\R$ (one consequence of this is that fields must have at least two elements)
> - **F6 - Existence of Additive Inverses:** For every $a\in\R$ there is a unique element $-a\in\R$ such that $a+(-a)=0$
> - **F7 - Existence of Multiplicative Inverses:** For every $a\in\R$ and $a\ne0$ there is a unique element $a^{-1}\in\R$ such that $a\cdot(a^{-1})=1$
> - **F8 - Distributive Law:** 
> 	- $a\cdot (b+c) = a\cdot b + a\cdot c$
> 	- $(b+c)\cdot a=(b\cdot a) + (c\cdot a)$ 
> 	- (this is the only law connecting addition with multiplication)

#### Other Information
> [!Remark]
> Sets that don't satisfy all of these are important in other contexts.
> - Properties F1 - F4 and F6 together mean that $(\R,+)$ is a commutative ([[Abelian Group|Abelian]]) group. 
> - Properties F1 - F3, F5, F6 mean that ($\R\backslash\{0\}, \cdot$) is a commutative ([[Abelian Group|Abelian]]) group.
