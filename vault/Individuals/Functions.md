> [!Definition] Def: [[Functions|Injective Function]]
> A function $f: X\to Y$ is called *injective* if:
> - The function is one to one, in other words one element of $X$ maps to one element of $Y$
> - $f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2})$ implies that $x_{1}=x_{2}$, or if $x_{1}\ne x_{2}$ then $f(x_{1}) \ne f(x_{2})$

> [!Definition] Def: [[Functions|Surjective Function]]
> A function $f: X\to Y$ is called *surjective* if:
> - Every element of $Y$ has a mapping from at least one element of $X$
> - For every $y\in Y$, there exists an $x\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$
> - $\forall y\in Y, \enspace \exists x\in X,\enspace f(x) = y$

> [!Definition] Def: [[Functions|Bijective Function]]
> A function $f: X\to Y$ is called *bijective* if it is both [[Functions#Functions Injective Function|injective]] and [[Functions#Functions Surjective Function|surjective]]
