> [!Remark]+ Rem: [[Functor|Category Category]]
> Think of categories as objects, and functors as arrows. You can compose functors in the same way as any object, and each category $C$ has an identity functor $1_{C}:C\to C$.
> Therefore, we can construct the category of all categories and functors $\text{Cat}$
