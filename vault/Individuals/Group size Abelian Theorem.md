> Suppose that $G$ is a group with $\lvert G \rvert < 6$. Then $G$ is [[Abelian Group|abelian]]

###### Proof
- If $\lvert G \rvert = 1$, then $G$ is abelian
- If $\lvert G \rvert =$ $2$, $3$, or $5$, then $G$ is cyclic by the [[Prime size group theorem]]
- The only other case is $\lvert G \rvert = 4$.
