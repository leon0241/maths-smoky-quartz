> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Homomorphism]]
> A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type. 
> Homomorphisms preseve operations of structures. This means that a map $f:A\to B$ between two sets $A,B$ equipped with the same structure s.t. if $\cdot$ is an operation then $f(x\cdot y)=f(x)\cdot f(y)$

> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Homomorphism|Group Homomorphisms]]
> Let $(G,*),(H,\circ)$ be groups. A map $\phi:G\to H$ is called a *group homomorphism* if
> $$\phi(x*y)=\phi(x)\circ\phi(y)\quad \text{for all } x,y\in G$$
> Note that the product on the left is formed using the group operation in $G$, while the product on the right is formed using the group operation in $H$
