> Let $\phi:G\to H$ be a [[Homomorphism#^1f6dd3|group homomorphism]].
> 1. The image of $\phi$ is defined to be
> $$\Im{\phi} := \{h\in H\,|\,h=\phi(g)\text{ for some } g\in G\}$$
> 2. The *kernel* of $\phi$ is defined to be
> $$\ker{\phi}:= \{g\in G\,|\,\phi(g) = e_{H}\}$$
> Note: $\Im{\phi}$ is a subgroup of $H$ and $\ker{\phi}$ is a subgroup of $G$
