> An *isomorphism* between two graphs is a [[Functions#Functions Bijective Function|bijection]] between them that preserves all edges. More precisely, if $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ are graphs, with sets of vertices $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ respectively, then an *isomorphism* from $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ is a bijection
> $$f : V_{1}\to V_{2}$$
> such that $f(v_{1})$ and $f(v_{2})$ are joined by an edge if and only if $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are also joined by an edge.
> We say that $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ are *isomorphic* if there exists an isomorphism $f:\Gamma_{1}\to\Gamma_{2}$

> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Isomorphism|Isomorphisms in Category Theory]]
> In any [[Definition of a Category|category]] $C$, an arrow $f:A\to B$ is called an *isomorphism* if there is an arrow $g:B\to A$ in $C$ such that
> $$g\circ f=1_{A} \quad \text{and} \quad f\circ g=1_{B}$$
> since $g$ can also be thought of as the inverse of $f$, we write $g=f^{-1}$. We say that $A$ is *isomorphic* to $B$, written $A\iso B$, if there exists an isomorphism between them

> A [[Homomorphism#^1f6dd3|group homomorphism]] $\phi:G\to H$ that is also a [[Functions#^6bb763|bijection]] is called an *isomorphism* of groups. In this case we say that $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic*. An isomorphism $G\to G$ is called an *automorphism* of $G$.
