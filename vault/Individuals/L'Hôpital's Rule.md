> Let $x_{0}\in (a,b)$ and let $f,g:(a,b)\backslash \{x_{0}\}\to\R$ be two differentiable functions such that
> $$\lim_{x \to x_{0}} f(x),g(x) \to 0$$
> Suppose that for all $x \in(a,b)\backslash \{x_{0}\}$ we have $g(x),g'(x)\ne 0$ and the limit
> $$\lim_{x \to x_{0}} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=L $$
> exists and is a real number. Then
> $$\lim_{x \to x_{0}} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} $$
> exists and is equal to $L$
