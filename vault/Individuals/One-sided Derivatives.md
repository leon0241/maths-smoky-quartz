> - **Right derivative:** Let $x_{0},b\in R,\,x_{0}<b$. A function $f:[x_{0},b)\to \R$ is said to be differentiable from the right at $x_{0}$ if and only if the one-sided limit
> $$\lim_{x \to x_{0}^+} \frac{f(x) - f(x_{0})}{x-x_{0}}$$
> exists and is a real number. We denote this limit by $f'(x_{0}^+)$
> **Left derivative:** Let $x_{0},b\in R,\,a<x_{0}$. A function $f:(a,x_{0}]\to \R$ is said to be differentiable from the left at $x_{0}$ if and only if the one-sided limit
> $$\lim_{x \to x_{0}^-} \frac{f(x) - f(x_{0})}{x-x_{0}}$$
> exists and is a real number. We denote this limit by $f'(x_{0}^-)$
