For posets to be categories, the other conditions must also be satisfied
- **Composition:** We need to know that if $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ are monotone, then $g\circ f:A\to C$ is also monotone. It follows that
$$a\le a' \implies f(a)\le f(a') \implies g(f(a))\le g(f(a'))\implies (g\circ f)(a)\le (g\circ f)(a')$$
- Identity?
