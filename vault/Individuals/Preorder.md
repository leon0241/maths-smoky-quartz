> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Preorder]]
> A *preorder* is a set $P$ equipped wtih a binary relation $p\le q$ that is both reflexive and transitive: $a\le a$, and if $a\le b$ and $b\le c$, then $a\le c$. Any preorder P can be regarded as a category by taking the objects to be the elements of $P$ and taking a unique arrow,
> $$a\to b \text{ if and only if } a\le b$$
> The reflextive and transitive conditions on $\le$ ensure that it is a category.
> Additionally, any category with at most one arrow between two objects determines a preorder, simply by defining a binary relation $\le$ on the objects.
