> Suppose that $G$ is a group with $\lvert G \rvert=p$, where $p$ is prime. Then $G$ is a [[Cyclic Subgroups|cyclic group]]

###### Proof
Choose $g\in G$ with $g\ne e$. Then $H:=\langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$ with at least two elements ($e$ and $g$). But by [[Lagrange's Theorem]], $\lvert H \rvert$ must divide $\lvert G \rvert = p$. $\lvert H \rvert \geq 2$, Hence $\lvert H \rvert=p$ and so $H = G$
