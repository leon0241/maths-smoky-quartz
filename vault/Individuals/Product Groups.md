> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Product Groups]]
> Let $(H,*)$ and $(K,\circ)$ be two groups. Define an operation $\star$ on the Cartesian product
> $$H \times K = \{(h,k): h\in H,\,k\in K\}$$
> by
> $$(h_{1},k_{1}) \star (h_{2},k_{2}) = (h_{1}*h_{2},h_{1}\circ k_{2})$$
> The group $(H\times K, \star)$ is called the *product* of the groups $(H,*)$ and $(K,\circ)$

> [!Example]+ Ex: $\Z_{2} \times \Z_{3}$
> in the slides
