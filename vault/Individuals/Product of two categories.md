> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Product of two categories]]
> The *product* of two categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$, written as
> $$\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D}$$
> has objects of the form $(C,D)$, for $C\in \mathcal{C}$ and $D\in \mathcal{D}$, and arrows of the form
> $$(f,g):(C,D)\to (C',D')$$
> for $f:C\to C'\in \mathcal{C}$ and $g:D\to D'\in \mathcal{D}$. Composition and identities are defined componentwise, that is,
> $$(f',g')\circ(f,g)=(f'\circ f, g'\circ g)$$
> $$1_{C,D}=(1_{C}, 1_{D})$$
> There are two obvious *projection functions*
> $$\mathcal{C}\xleftarrow{\pi_1}\mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{D} \xrightarrow{\pi_{2}} \mathcal{D}$$
> defined by $\pi_{1}(C,D)=C$ and $\pi_{1}(f,g)=f$, and same for $\pi_{2}$
