> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Product of two subgroups of a group]]
> Let $(G,*)$ be a group and $H,K$ be subgroups of $G$. The subset $HK$ of $G$ is defined by
> $$HK=\{h*k:h\in H,\,k\in K\}$$

> [!Remark]+ Rem: Is $HK$ always a subgroup of $G$? 
> Closure? Let $g,g'\in HK$. Then $g=h*k$ and $g'=h'*k'$ for some $h,h'$ in $H$, $k,k'$ in $K$ Then
