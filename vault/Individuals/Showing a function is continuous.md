> [!Theorem]+ Thm: [[Showing a function is continuous]]
> A function $f$ is continuous is for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that for all $x \in A$ for which $0<\lvert x-c \rvert <\delta$, we have $\lvert f(x)-L \rvert < \epsilon$.

> To show a function isn't continuous, negate the above statement to get:
> There exists $\epsilon>0$ such that for all $\delta>0$ there exists some $x \in A$ satisfying $0<\lvert x-c \rvert<\delta$ for which $\lvert  f(x)-L \rvert\ge \epsilon$
