> [!Definition]+ Def: [[Symmetry]]
> A *symmetry* of a graph is an [[Isomorphism#Isomorphism|isomorphism]] from the graph to itself, i.e. if the set of vertices is V, then the symmetry is a bijection $f:V\to V$ that preserves edges. That is, a symmetry is a bijection $f:V\to V$ such that $f(v_{1})$ and $f(v_{2})$ are joined by an edge if and only if $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are joined by an edge.

> [!Remark] Rem: [[Symmetry|Valency Preservation of symmetries]]
> A symmetry $f:V\to V$ must preserve the valency of a vertex. For example, if $v_{1}$ has valency three, then $f(v_{1})$ must also have valency three.
