> [!Theorem]+ Thm: [[Taylor's Formula with remainder]]
> Let $f:I\to\R$ be $n+1$ times differentiable and $x_{0}\in I$, $I$ open interal. For every $x \in I$, there is a $c$ between $x_{0}$ and $x$ such that
> $$f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(x_{0})}{k!} (x-x_{0})^k + \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_{0})^{n+1}$$
> (c depends on $x$ and $n$)
