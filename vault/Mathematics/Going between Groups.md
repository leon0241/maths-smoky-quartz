> [!Remark]+ Rem: [[Going between Groups|Base Isomorphic group]]
> From the [[Cyclic Isomorphism Theorem|cyclic isomorphism theorem]], it follows that
> - Every cyclic group of order $n$ is isomorphic to $(\Z_{n},+)$
> - Every cyclic group of infinite order is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z},+)$
> 
> We say "Up to isomorphism, the only cyclic group of order $n$ is $(\mathbb{Z}_{n}, +)$", or "Up to isomorphism, the only infinite cyclic group is $(\mathbb{Z},+)$"
