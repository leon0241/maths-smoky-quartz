![[Definition of a Monoid#^57cfb9]]

> [!Remark]+ Rem: [[Monoids and Category Isomorphisms|Intuition of the Monoid Category]]
> It can be weird to think of a monoid is a category with one object. A monoid can have lots of *elements* but in this case the elements are the *arrows* and not the objects. Instead of a function "add $1$" that transforms $1$ to $2$, there is just an arrow called $1$, and an arrow called $2$.
> For the integers on addition $1 + 1 = 2$ is really just a composition $1\circ 1$ where the output is the arrow $2$.
> The single object in question does not really matter, it can be the vtuber Hoshimachi Suisei, it is just there for the definition of a category. An example is shown below

> A [[Homomorphism#^f3e79f|homomorphism]] of groups $h:G\to H$ is just a homomorphism of [[Definition of a Monoid#^57cfb9|monoids]], which then necessarily also preserves the inverses
