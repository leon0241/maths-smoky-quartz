If $f(x)$ is even,
$$\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 2\int_{0}^{a} f(x) \, dx  $$
If $f(x)$ is odd,
$$\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0  $$

1.3.2 and 1.3.3 shows that $h$ is part of the dihedral group, the reason for $hg, hg^{2},\dots$ is so you can keep $h$ being only a horizontal reflection and the rest of reflections is like "rotated some amount then flip", but $h$ is still part of $D_{3}$, since it is a unique operation

1.3.3 states there's $2n$ elements in $D_{n}$ which is obtained by:
- Identity ($e$) and $n-1$ unique rotations ($\{g,g^{2},\dots g^{n-1}\}$) for $n$ elements
- Identity flipped ($h$) and $n-1$ flipped rotations ($\{hg,hg^{2},\dots hg^{n-1}\}$) for $n$ elements
You can get $2n$ elements technically without $h$ if you include $hg^n$ instead, but that is the same thing, as the $g^n=e\implies hg^n=h$
